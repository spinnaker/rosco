  /**
   * This method is responsible for:
   *   - Producing an image name.
   *   - (If one or more package names are specified) Attempting to derive the AppVersion descriptor from the
   *     first package name. If the AppVersion could not be derived, this value will be null.
   *   - This is temporary and will be removed shortly: (If one or more package names are specified) Replacing
   *     the first package name in the list of packages with just the 'packageName' value from the derived AppVersion.
   *     This is here as a temporary workaround for test/dev since we are not actually publishing the built packages
   *     to a deb repo yet (so any reference to a fully-qualified debian package would fail to be resolved).
   *
   * This method always returns a list of size 3 with the following elements:
   *   1) A derived image name (to be used for naming the image being baked).
   *   2) The appversion string (to be used for tagging the newly-baked image).
   *   3) The updated list of packages to be used for overriding the passed package list (this will be removed once the
   *      temporary workaround described above is removed).
   *
   * This function is not required to return the same image name on multiple invocations with the same bake request.
   *
   * Returns [imageName, appVersionStr, packagesParameter].
